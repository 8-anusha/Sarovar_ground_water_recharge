          <h1 >Why do we need to save lakes?</h1>
          <p class="concernp">
                The primary objective of an individual who works is to have a shelter, a mode of transport, healthy food and clean drinking water. All of these are threatened when the ecosystem is threatened and nature wreaks havoc. As is evident from the above pics, posh and luxurious villas, branded well built cars were inundated by the rains in 2022 along with scarcity of drinking water and hygiene was affected as well. Food prices also hit the sky when rains are uncontrolled or scarce, leading to a huge disparity in the demand supply ratio. Thus it means nothing if the well to do educated IT crowd earning the maximum, is also not able to afford clean water, safe homes, or mode of transport, and is having to compromise on the lifestyle, because the eco system has been upset. This draws our attention to the primary root cause of all the above issues, our eco system which is centered around our lakes. 
                Bengaluru was known as the city of lakes, which acted as rescuers from floods as well as droughts. Intense urbanisation process led to encroachment of wetlands, flood-plains, etc. causing floodway obstruction. With the loss of natural flood storage in Bengaluru, flooding had worsened by unauthorised developments along the lakes. In the wake of urbanisation, the network between the water bodies is completely broken, making them independent entities. Choked drains led to residential parts of the city being inundated. It demonstrated how unplanned, rapid urban development has stretched the natural ecosystems in and around a city to its limits, and made disaster from natural flood hazards inevitable and more destructive.
“Urbanisation across the city continues to be unchecked, maximising on the most the city has. Bengaluru is doing nothing for adaptation. Political system and will is not aligned with climate resilient policy. In fact, there has been no political stability to battle climate risk as 15 chief ministers have changed in the last 20 years,” said Dr Anjal Prakash, Research Director and Adjunct Professor, Bharti School of Public Policy, Indian School of Business & IPCC Author.
